When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to show your code to other people, to ask them for advice, to share it, or when several people
working together on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
 your remote repository?
 
 I want to pull only when there is a point to do so, other people might also use the commits or work upon them,
 so it's crucial to be meaningful ones and not random.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 
 Fork is good if i want to work on somebody's else project on my own and not cooperatively. Clones are good 
 to copy project on different pc's i happen to work on regularly. Branches are good every time i want to start
 working on a new feature, especially if i want to work on several new features on the same time.
