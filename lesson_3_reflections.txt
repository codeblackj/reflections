When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to show your code to other people, to ask them for advice, to share it, or when several people
working together on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
 your remote repository?
 
 I want to pull only when there is a point to do so, other people might also use the commits or work upon them,
 so it's crucial to be meaningful ones and not random.
