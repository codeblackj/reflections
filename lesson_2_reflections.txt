What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I start keeping track of my progress working on a project. Can easily experiment and progress towards
 different goals in the same time.
 Generally is a good and smart thing to do. Being able to have versions for your project and switching 
 among them for debugging or safe haven if you suddently come up with something like "panic! The impossible 
 just happened!".
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
 it offers?
 
 When working in 3 files you can add them in the staging area one at a time when you finished your job in them.
 Trying to make an example you might have a working directory with 10 files, 3 files in staging area and none
 in the repository. Potentially you will end up having the same numbers of files in the working directory and
 the repository and only a few each time in the staging area.
 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing it with working directory and/or latest commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would
 branches help?
 
 When you decide that you are gonna deliver more than one versions of the same product. Like easy,
 medium, hard games or like ms office home, professional etc. Or like English, Greek, or any other
 language etc. Or when you want to try a new feature that you are not sure about. Or when you are dubious
  which path to take among 2 or more possible solutions to a problem and want to try all...
