What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I start keeping track of my progress working on a project. Can easily experiment and progress towards
 different goals in the same time.
 Generally is a good and smart thing to do. Being able to have versions for your project and switching 
 among them for debugging or safe haven if you suddently come up with something like "panic! The impossible 
 just happened!".
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
 it offers?
 
 When working in 3 files you can add them in the staging area one at a time when you finished your job in them.
 Trying to make an example you might have a working directory with 10 files, 3 files in staging area and none
 in the repository. Potentially you will end up having the same numbers of files in the working directory and
 the repository and only a few each time in the staging area.
